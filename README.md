# About this Repository
This repository contains our approach to Offensive Content Detection in audio. 

The training code of the models can be reached in their respective folders.

The datasets should be downloaded and cleaned using the preprocessing step and saved into a folder named 'datasets' in the root directory.



## About old_code
Folder structure was revised. 

Most of the code that have been used that resided in the root directory were combined into single compact files according to their models.
